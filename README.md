### Why I created this app?
This is just a dummy application to kick start my ember skills. Here main concern of application is more on technical part then styling. That is, I focused more on a handling data like avoiding of accessing of data repeatedly.

### Installing
Before running the application you need to install ember.js.
```
npm install -g ember-cli
```
After installation of ember run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.

After succesfull install of everything we needed run ```ember -s``` in console to deploy the app in your localhost:4200.

Run ```ember -t ``` to view all the testing done.
